However, I will recommend that the company need to look into the sales flow from January to march and critically examine the reason for inconsistency in the sales flow. They can consider advertisement, bonuses or discount inclusion. 
Also the company need to be very sure they still meet up with the customers demand always, they need to be sure and understand perfectly well the demands of the customers.
The company need to look deep into why they have more female customers than male customers, and know the goods the female customers buys the most and also the goods the male customers buys. this also apply to the customer type, that is they need to know what drives the member customer.
Lastly the company can consider a kind of staff rotation between their staffs working in different branches to create a good uniform customer service and also pay alot of attention on their customer service.
